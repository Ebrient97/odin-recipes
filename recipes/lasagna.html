    <p>3 Reasons This Is the Best, Easiest Lasagna Ever
        This lasagna isn’t complicated. There are three things about it that really make it the best (and the easiest). These are also tips that will ensure cozy casserole success.
        
        This recipe uses store-bought sauce (make sure you get one you love). There are just three components that make a lasagna great: the pasta, the cheese, and the sauce. Since this recipe starts with a jar of marinara for ease, make sure it’s one that tastes great. My favorite brand is Rao’s, but choose your personal favorite.
        The lasagna noodles cook right in the sauce. Since the noodles aren’t pre-boiled, they’ll cook from the heat and steam in the oven. It’s important that they’re completely covered in the sauce so they cook evenly. A dry corner will result in a crunchy, un-cooked corner.
        The lasagna can (and should) rest before eating. Like all lasagnas, this one is great made ahead, and actually will be better made a little ahead of eating. Yes it’s tempting to cut into the lasagna right when you pull it from the oven, but let it rest on a cooling rack for at least 15 minutes. This will help firm up all the layers and make it much easier to slice a square. And of course you can make it a day ahead or in the morning then reheat.
        Why I Don’t Call for No-Boil Noodles
        While classic dry lasagna noodles are typically boiled before they’re layered, there’s no real reason why you have to cook them ahead of time — they can actually be layered in with the sauce and cheese as is. And yes, this is just regular lasagna noodles! No-boil lasagna noodles are a modern convenience, but honestly I’m not a huge fan of them — I find they almost always get overcooked in the casserole.</p>
